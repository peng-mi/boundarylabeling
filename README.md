Boundary-Labeling
================
This project is about bounday labeling. Bounday labeling is the label placement problem in information visualization. In maps, diagrams
features like points, lines must be labelled to convey information. The computational complexity of the label-placement problem is 
NP-hard in general. This project implements several bounday lableing algorithms based on approximation, and uses Java Swing for
visualization.
